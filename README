Stephen's Kernel Tools
----------------------

This repo contains a few scripts I find useful for kernel hacking.

Installation
------------

I normally have a top-level folder called kernel which I place this
repo into. I then have a number of sub-folders:

linux-<arch> - the linux tree, copies for each ARCH I am working on.
configs - a folder for all the configs I use, I don't repo this.
debs - a folder of handy output .debs. Again I don't repo this.

build-kernel-deb
----------------

build-kernel-deb is a shell script that builds kernel debian package
files for installation of linux kernel. See the notes in the file for
more information. Note that cross-compilation is not yet supported in
this script.

An example run of this script that would build a p2pdma enabled kernel
based on version 4 of the patchsets would be:

REMOTE=https://github.com/sbates130272/linux-p2pmem \
  REMOTE_BRANCH=pci-p2p-v4 \
  CONFIG=<config-file> \
  ./build-kernel-deb

And an example that builds a monolithic kernel based on the default
config (with all modules converted to "yes") for v4.14.30 would be:

REMOTE= git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git \
  REMOTE_BRANCH=v4.14.30 \
  CONFIG=<config-file> \
  ./build-kernel-deb

Note all files associated with the unique generation of this kernel
(the .config and the <path-file> (if present) are included in the
output tarball along with a .build-info file that contains the
information needed to reproduce the .debs.
