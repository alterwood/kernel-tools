Stephen's Kernel Tools
----------------------

This repo contains a few scripts I find useful for kernel hacking.

Installation
------------

I normally have a top-level folder called kernel which I place this
repo into. I then have a number of sub-folders:

linux-<arch> - the linux tree, copies for each ARCH I am working on.
configs - a folder for all the configs I use, I don't repo this.
debs - a folder of handy output .debs. Again I don't repo this.
