Stephen's Kernel Tools
----------------------

This repo contains a few scripts I find useful for kernel hacking.

Installation
------------

I normally have a top-level folder called kernel which I place this
repo into. I then have a number of sub-folders:

linux-<arch> - the linux tree, copies for each ARCH I am working on.
configs - a folder for all the configs I use, I don't repo this.
debs - a folder of handy output .debs. Again I don't repo this.

build-kernel-deb
----------------

build-kernel-deb is a shell script that builds kernel debian package
files for installation of linux kernel. See the notes in the file for
more information.

An example run of this script that would build a p2pdma enabled kernel
based on version 4 of the patchsets would be:

REMOTE=https://github.com/sbates130272/linux-p2pmem \
  REMOTE_BRANCH=pci-p2p-v4 \
  CONFIG=<config-file> \
  ./build-kernel-deb

And an example that builds a monolithic kernel based on the default
config (with all modules converted to "yes") for v4.14.30 would be:

REMOTE= git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git \
  REMOTE_BRANCH=v4.14.30 \
  MONO=yes \
  ./build-kernel-deb

And an example that builds a non-monolithic kernel based on the default
config (with all modules converted to "yes") for v4.14.30 for arm64 on
a non-arm64 host system would be:

REMOTE= git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git \
  REMOTE_BRANCH=v4.14.30 \
  ARCH=arm64 \
  CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- \
  ./build-kernel-deb

Note all files associated with the unique generation of this kernel
(the .config and the <path-file> (if present) are included in the
output tarball along with a .build-info file that contains the
information needed to reproduce the .debs.

build-latest-p2pdma-kernel
--------------------------

A little helper script around build-kernel-deb that should always
point to the latest and greatest p2pdma kernel. Run this to generate a
p2pdma kernel unless you know what you are doing and want to
modify. Only support x86_64 right now.
